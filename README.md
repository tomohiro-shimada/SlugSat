Designed a low-budget, low-power solution to maintain an accurate realtime clock abiding to the requirements given by the Santa Cruz Institute of Particle Physics (SCIPP). Created a simulation file as proof of concept for a proposed time correction method, which achieved 1.9 ms maximum absolute timing drift from a reference clock over 2 years.
